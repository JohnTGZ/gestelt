# Metrics to measure
MAKE SURE TO BUILD IN RELEASE MODE

- Explanation of metrics 
    - Network 
        - Signal strength 
            - `iw dev wlan0 link` or `watch -n1 iwconfig`
        - Bandwidth (Network capacity), total messages sizes
            - Maximum rate that information can be transferred
            - `sudo iftop`
        - Throughput 
            - Actual rate that information is transferred
            - TCP Mode
                - On PC A, set up server `iperf -s`, take note of tcp port number
                - On PC B, set up client connecting to IP of PC A: `iperf -c PC_A_IP`
            - UDP Mode
                - On PC A, set up server `iperf -s -u`, take note of tcp port number
                - On PC B, set up client connecting to IP of PC A: `iperf -c PC_A_IP -u -b 1000m`
        - Latency
            - Delay between sender and receiver decoding it. Function of signals travel time, and processing time at any nodes the information traverses 
            - use `sudo mtr --no-dns --report --report-cycles 60 IP_ADDR` or `ping`
        - Jitter
            - Variation in packet delay at the receiver of the information
    - Hardware (Radxa)
        - CPU Usage `htop`
        - Wall time (aka 'real' time )
            - Elapsed time from start to finish of the call. Includes time slices used by other processes and the time the process spends blocked (waiting for I/O to complete
            )
        - CPU Runtime (aka 'user' time)
            - Amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within the process. Only actual CPU time used in executing the process.
        - System time
            - Amount of time spent within the kernel, as opposed to library code. Could include I/O, allocating memory.
        - Sometimes Sys + user > real, as multiple processors work in parallel.
        - What is important to us is the 'real' time as we want to ensure that the planner is able to plan with a high enough frequency
        - Measure for planner, Depth map
    - ROS
        - Measure message size: `rostopic bw`
        - Measure frequency of publishing: `rostopic hz`
        - Measure delay: `rostopic delay`
    - Integration tests 
        - Replan frequency
        - Tracking error
        - Success rate
        - Maximum flight speed it can enable in sparse/dense environment
        - Maximum number of UAVs it can handle
