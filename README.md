A simple path planning framework for swarm robots. This is a work in progress, and a lot of existing components are refactored parts of the work done by ZJU in [EGO-Planner-V2 repo](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/EGO-Planner-v2).

# Setup
Refer to [general_setup.md](./docs/general_setup.md)

# Acknowledgements
Plenty of inspiration was taken from the [EGO-Planner-V2 repo](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/EGO-Planner-v2) from ZJU, without which, this would not have been possible.
