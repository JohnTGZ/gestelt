# Physical dimensions
Volume: 0.178m x 0.178m x 0.075m.
Mass: 0.2 kg (without camera), 0.35 kg (with camera) 
Assuming it is a spherical object:
- Diameter: 0.252m
- Radius: 0.126m

Recommended inflation:
- At least 0.126m
- Recommended to be 0.2m

# Dynamical constraints
Can produce up to 8 Newtons of thrust in z axis.
We take it as 6 newtons
- Assuming without camera (0.2 kg):
    - max_acc = 30.0 m/s^2
- Assuming with camera (0.35 kg):
    - max_acc = 20.0 m/s^2

# We have up to 8 Newtons of thrust for the Nuswarm drone
